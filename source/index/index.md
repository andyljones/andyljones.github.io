## Me
I'm a London-based machine learning researcher. After stints in biotech and quant finance, I now spend my days working on whatever AI project takes my fancy.

You can get in touch with me by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andy_l_jones) or [email](mailto:andyjones.ed@gmail.com). 

## Posts
* [Are we in an AI overhang?](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N6vZEnCn6A95Xn39p/are-we-in-an-ai-overhang): AIs will get much, much larger in 2021.

## Projects
Most of my recent major work is NDA'd. 

**Major**
* [megastep](https://andyljones.com/megastep/): A 1m FPS RL environment.
* [pybbfmm](https://andyljones.com/pybbfmm/): A GPU-accelerated black-box fast multipole method.
* [RL Discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/jawm37/official_reinforcement_learning_discord/): One reinforcement learning Discord to rule them all.

**Minor**
* [coolgpus](https://github.com/andyljones/coolgpus): Custom GPU fan control for headless Linux.
* [kvbtests](https://github.com/andyljones/kvbtests): Heteroskedasticity-and-autocorrelation-robust statistical tests.
* [modulepickle](https://github.com/andyljones/modulepickle): Makes distributed dev feel local by auto-shipping your working dir to workers.
* [zonotable](https://github.com/andyljones/zonotable): Nails Zotero's paper ingestion onto the side of [Notable](https://github.com/notable/notable).

**Trivial**
* [tablatex](https://github.com/andyljones/tablatex): Adds LaTeX symbol autocomplete to vscode.
* [nosearch](https://github.com/andyljones/nosearch): Adds reverse search to Jupyter notebooks.
* [noterminal](https://github.com/andyljones/noterminal): Adds disposable notebooks to Jupyter.
* [stripcommon](https://github.com/andyljones/stripcommon): Strips the common whitespace when copying into Jupyter.

**Old**

These are my portfolio pieces from my first year learning to program, c. 2013.
* [Commutes & Rent](http://andyljones.com/commutes-and-rent-frontend): An interactive visualization of commutes and rent in London. 
* [A Global Shallow Fluid Model](http://andyljones.com/shallow-fluid-model): An interactive model of the atmosphere on a rotating planet.
* [Segmenting Microarrays with Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/andyljones/NeuralNetworkMicroarraySegmentation): Automation of a labour intensive part of DNA microarrays.

**Website**

This website is rendered [from Markdown](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/source/post-mortem-plotting/index.md) into [a minimal template](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/template.j2) by [a short Python script](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/generate.py). It uses a self-hosted [Matomo instance](https://matomo.org/) for analytics, stripped down to [only the details I'd see in the server logs](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/template.j2#L36-L37).
