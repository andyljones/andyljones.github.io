## Me
I'm a London-based machine learning researcher. After stints in biotech and quant finance, I now spend my days working on whatever AI project takes my fancy.

You can get in touch with me by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andy_l_jones) or [email](mailto:andyjones.ed@gmail.com).

## Projects
Most of my recent major work is NDA'd. 

**Major**
* [megastep](https://andyljones.com/megastep/): A 1m FPS RL environment.
* [pybbfmm](https://andyljones.com/pybbfmm/): A GPU-accelerated black-box fast multipole method.

**Minor**
* [coolgpus](https://github.com/andyljones/coolgpus): Custom GPU fan control for headless Linux.
* [kvbtests](https://github.com/andyljones/kvbtests): Heteroskedasticity-and-autocorrelation-robust statistical tests.

**Old**

These are my portfolio pieces from my first ~year as a researcher. While they don't reflect my current interests or abilities, I'm still proud of them.
* [Commutes & Rent](http://andyljones.com/commutes-and-rent-frontend): An interactive visualization of commutes and rent in London. 
* [A Global Shallow Fluid Model](http://andyljones.com/shallow-fluid-model): An interactive model of the atmosphere on a rotating planet.
* [Segmenting Microarrays with Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/andyljones/NeuralNetworkMicroarraySegmentation): Automation of a labour intensive part of DNA microarrays.
