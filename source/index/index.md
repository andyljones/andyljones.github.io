## me
I work on reinforcement learning, language models and AI safety at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com). My particular interests are [donating to the Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/) and trying to reduce the downsides of AI - social, political or existential.

That said, I'm pretty chatty and keen to talk to most anyone about anything. The best way to get in touch with me is via [email](mailto:me@andyljones.com)!

## posts
* [AI Safety Needs Great Engineers](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DDDyTvuZxoKStm92M/ai-safety-needs-great-engineers): AI safety labs are bottlenecked on great engineering.
{{posts}}
* [Are we in an AI overhang?](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N6vZEnCn6A95Xn39p/are-we-in-an-ai-overhang): AIs might get much larger very quickly.

**website**

This website is rendered [from Markdown](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/source/post-mortem-plotting/index.md) into [a minimal template](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/template.j2) by [a short Python script](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/generate.py). It uses a self-hosted [Matomo instance](https://matomo.org/) for analytics, stripped down to [only the details I'd see in the server logs](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/template.j2).
