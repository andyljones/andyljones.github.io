## me
I'm an engineer-researcher at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com), where I've moved between projects as demand dictates. So far that's meant building much of our early RL infrastructure, our sandboxing infrastructure, leading the multimodal effort and working on big-model training.

Outside of my day-to-day, I'm particularly interested in test-time compute, science-of-AI, interpretability, and the social impacts of AI - especially with regards to future-of-work, concentration-of-power, and the dynamics that might emerge when many people start deferring their decisions to their AI assistants. 

All that said, I'm gregarious as researchers go and happy to talk to most anyone about anything. 
I'm based in DC but regularly travel to SF and (as a Brit) semi-regularly to London. The best way to get in touch with me is via [email](mailto:me@andyljones.com)!
