## me
I work on reinforcement learning, language models and AI safety at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com), where I tend towards RL- and engineering-flavoured projects. I'm also keen on [effective donation](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities).

That said, I'm chatty and happy to talk to most anyone about anything. The best way to get in touch with me is via [email](mailto:me@andyljones.com)!

## writing

**anthropic**
* [A Language Assistant as a Laboratory for Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00861): The two worst ways - prompting and fine-tuning - to align an AI.
* [Training a Helpful and Harmless Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05862): The _third_ worst way to align an AI, RL on human feedback.
* [Predictability and Surprise in Large Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07785): Connects scaling laws (and lack thereof) with near-term impacts.

**indie**
* [Scaling Scaling Laws with Board Games](https://andyljones.com/boardlaw/): Studying big AIs on big problems using small AIs on small problems.
* [AI Safety Needs Great Engineers](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DDDyTvuZxoKStm92M/ai-safety-needs-great-engineers): AI safety labs are bottlenecked on great engineering.
{{posts}}
* [Are we in an AI overhang?](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N6vZEnCn6A95Xn39p/are-we-in-an-ai-overhang): AIs might get much larger very quickly.
* [Segmenting Microarrays with Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/andyljones/NeuralNetworkMicroarraySegmentation): c. 2014, automation of a labour intensive part of DNA microarrays.

## projects

**old**

These are my portfolio pieces from my first year learning to program, c. 2013.
* [Commutes & Rent](http://andyljones.com/commutes-and-rent-frontend): An interactive visualization of commutes and rent in London. 
* [A Global Shallow Fluid Model](http://andyljones.com/shallow-fluid-model): An interactive model of the atmosphere on a rotating planet.

**website**

This website is rendered [from Markdown](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/source/post-mortem-plotting/index.md) into [a minimal template](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/template.j2) by [a short Python script](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/generate.py). It uses a self-hosted [Matomo instance](https://matomo.org/) for analytics, stripped down to [only the details I'd see in the server logs](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/template.j2).
