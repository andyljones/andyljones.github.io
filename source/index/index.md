## Me
I'm a machine learning researcher working on AI safety at [Anthropic](www.anthropic.com). I've previously worked on independent research, as a quant trader, and in biotech.

You can get in touch with me by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andy_l_jones) or [email](mailto:andyjones.ed@gmail.com). 

## Posts

**Website**

This website is rendered [from Markdown](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/source/post-mortem-plotting/index.md) into [a minimal template](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/template.j2) by [a short Python script](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/generate.py). It uses a self-hosted [Matomo instance](https://matomo.org/) for analytics, stripped down to [only the details I'd see in the server logs](https://github.com/andyljones/andyljones.github.io/blob/master/template.j2#L36-L37).
